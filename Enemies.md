Enemies on their turn have a few set actions they can take (different per enemy)

Basic enemy actions are:
- Attack
- Buff
- Heal

Enemies will display how many turns until they make an action and what type of action they are making.

If an enemy has an additional effect to their action the player can mouse over the icon in fight to learn what exactly it will do (Similar to [[Weapons#Attributes|Attributes]])
